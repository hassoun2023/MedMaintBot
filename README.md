# AI-Powered Chatbot for Biomedical Device Maintenance

MedMaintBot is an intelligent chatbot designed to support biomedical engineers and technicians in managing and troubleshooting medical device maintenance.
It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), domain-specific NLP, and machine learning models to provide accurate, context-aware answers to maintenance requests.

The system was developed and tested at the Industrial Engineering Laboratory of ENSAM-Meknès, in Morocco, in collaboration with biomedical engineering experts.
It integrates device manuals, hospital maintenance scenarios, and predictive analytics to assist in reducing downtime, optimizing technician assignment, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
